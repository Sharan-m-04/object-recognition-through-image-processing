# object-recognition-through-image-processing
A mini project on "Object Recognition Through Image Processing" for the 6th sem curriculum at VTU. This project uses OpenCV and NumPy to detect and classify objects in images. Leveraging the SSD MobileNet V3 Large COCO dataset, it demonstrates efficient object detection and image preprocessing techniques for enhanced accuracy.
